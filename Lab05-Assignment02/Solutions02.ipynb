In particular, whatever your answer was for Problem 1.1, all of those binary operations can be expressed as some combination of **NOT**, **AND**, and **OR**.  This is important for probability theory, which is built on expressions for probabilities for these three operations on propositions.\n",

      "Digital computers are essentially propositional logic computing devices, built using \"logic gate\" circuit elements that implement basic logic (and memory) functions.  A key component of a CPU chip in a computer is an *arithmetic logic unit* (ALU) that performs arithmetic and bitwise logic operations on bytes and larger groups of binary digits (bits).  The ALU is built from simple gates that implement desired operations via truth table representations.  For example, the addition of the lowermost bits, $A$ and $B$, of two numbers can be expressed by the following truth table:\n",

Two logic functions implementing this table comprise a *half adder* (a *full adder* is a trinary operation that handles an additional carry bit input).\n",
