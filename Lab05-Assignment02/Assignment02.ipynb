For propositions $A$ and $B$, with 0 denoting *False* and 1 denoting *True*, the following truth tables describe these operations (I've separated inputs from outputs with an empty column; note that the IPy notebook's table renderer may split \"$A\\land B$\", etc., across a line):\n",

For example, **OR** is defined to correspond to *inclusive* \"or\" in English, but we could also define an *exclusive* \"or\" operation (\"either $A$ or $B$, but not both\"), denoted by $\\veebar$ and called **XOR**, according to the following truth table:\n",

They performed numerous ingenious survey-based experiments designed to uncover the heuristics people use to reason amidst uncertainty.  One of their most famous experiments featured the following problem:\n",

They used this finding (among many others) to show that humans reason using *heuristics*, mental shortcuts that may give a usable result or decision quickly in some circumstances, but not always the *correct* or *optimal* answer.  For this cab problem, the evidence for use of heuristics came from realizing that the typical answer is *wrong*, i.e., that most people do not reason correctly in this problem."
